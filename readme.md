Programmable Earrings
=====================

A design for a small, light, circuit which can be made in to an earring. 
It uses a 12mm 3V button cell to power it and a ATTiny micro-controller
to produce a varying light pattern using an RGB LED and optionally a 
photo-resistor to influence the pattern.
